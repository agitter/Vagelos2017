### DWPC

I have almost completed an implementation of the degree-weighted path count (DWPC) in the form of several independent functions.
When a user calls the `dwpc` function over a metapath, a series of steps occur before any actual path-counting occurs.
First, the metapath is categorized according to its repeated metanodes.
For example, the metapath `GaDrDaG`, ('Gene-associates-Disease-resembles-Disease-associates-Gene') would be classified `BAAB`.
Further examples of this classification method are in Table @tbl:classification below.

Next, the metapath was split into segments according to its classification.
This step allowed for the abstraction of metapath patterns to metapaths which followed the pattern of a classification but included randomly inserted, metanodes anywhere in the bath.
Splitting the metapath essentially allowed us to work with paths like `A-B-C-D-B-A` in the same way that we work with `A-B-B-A`, by abstracting any non-repeating metanodes to within segments.

| Metapath | Classification | Segments |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| CbGiGbC | BAAB | CbG GiG GbC |
| DaGaDaG | BABA | DaG GaD DaG |
| DlAeGaDaG | BABA | DlAeG GaD DaG |
| CrCrC | short_repeat | CrCrC |
| DlAeG | no_repeats | DlAeG |
| CrCrCrC | long_repeat | CrCrCrC |
| CbGiGiGaDrDpCpD | interior_complete_group | CbG GiGiG GaD DrD DpC CpD |

Table: Example metapaths with classifications and segments {#tbl:classification}

Once the metapath is split into segments, the original metapath classification is used to select the appropriate dwpc function.
For example, if the metapath classification is `BAAB`, then the segmented metapath will be run in the function `dwpc_baab`.

Each DWPC function has a unique method for ensuring that it outputs a path-count rather than a walk count.
For many metapaths this was a non-trivial method to unravel, and often involved several steps of additions, subtractions, multiplications, and normalizations.
Our work was greatly aided by the help of a mathematician with whom we collaborated on some of the more challenging matrix operations.

In addition to the specific DWPC functions, I created a general method which will work over all metapaths, no matter the length.
While slower than the other methods, this function allows us to ensure that every path is covered by the DWPC.
The method uses a dictionary of history vectors for every index in the matrix and splits computations whenever a path has the opportunity to diverge into multiple potential paths.
