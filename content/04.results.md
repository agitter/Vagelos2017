## Results

The main problem towards which I worked this summer was an implementation of the degree-weighted path count.
While the degree-weighted walk count is relatively trivial to implement with matrix multiplication, the path count is non-trivial.
If computational efficiency is to be considered, each category of metapath will require a different path-count method.



I also gained a deeper appreciation of and respect for open-access and collaborative science.
In working towards this, I reported a bug in the open source Python repository SciPy which dealt with issues involving matrix multiplication [@url:https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7510].

In the deep learning review, I contributed a section on deep learning applications in the field of protein-protein interaction predictions, with a subsection on deep learning methods for the prediction of MHC-peptide binding [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/pull/638].
