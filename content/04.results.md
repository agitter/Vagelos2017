## Results



I also gained a deeper appreciation of and respect for open-access and collaborative science.
In working towards this, I reported a bug in the open source Python repository SciPy which dealt with issues involving matrix multiplication [@url:https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7510].

In the deep learning review, I contributed a section on deep learning applications in the field of protein-protein interaction predictions, with a subsection on deep learning methods for the prediction of MHC-peptide binding [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/pull/638].
