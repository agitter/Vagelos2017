## Methods

### Heterogeneous networks

Heterogeneous networks ('hetnets') are networks with multiple node types and edge types.
In the network used this summer, titled Hetionet v1.0 (Figure @fig:metagraph B), nodes represent instances of 11 biomedical entity types, and edges correspond to one of 24 edge types, or relationships between entities.
'Graph' in this context refers to the entire network of nodes and edges.
We define 'metagraph' to mean a graph of the types of nodes and edges in Hetionet (Figure @fig:metagraph A).


![A. Metagraph. The graph of metandoes (node types) and metaedges (edge) type. B. Graph (Hetionet v1.0) The circles and lines
represent nodes within the labeled types. For example, within the metanode 'Anatomy' we could have the node 'Leukocyte'.](images/metagraph.png){#fig:metagraph}


Hetionet v1.0 incorporated 47,031 nodes and 2,250,197 edges. A further breakdown of the nodes and edges can be found below in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
